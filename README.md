# GradeReportGenerator
This app takes in a scoresheet file from PowerTeacherPro and writes letters to the parents of each student in the report, listing their name, grade and number of missing assignments (and a list of what they are). Teacher / school specific fields can be saved for future use and the letter can be translated into Arabic/Spanish.
